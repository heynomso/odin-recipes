  <h3>Jollof Rice Recipe</h3>
  <p>
    There are hundreds of different dishes in the world, but there is only a handful that has enough flavor for me to eat alone. A bowl of Jollof rice is one of those dishes. You know, the kind where you can taste the spoon or fork after you’re done with the food? I mean, you’d want to lick it clean. Jollof is deliciously addictive.
    
    Jollof rice is a staple in West African cuisine. It’s made from rice, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and other seasonings. The dish is cooked in one pot. It’s simple and easy to make at home—and the end result is absolutely delicious!</p>
